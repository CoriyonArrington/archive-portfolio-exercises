// Since the existing code was omitted for brevity and the updates indicate undeclared variables,
// I will assume the variables are used within a function or component scope.
// I will declare them with appropriate types (assuming boolean based on the variable names)
// at the beginning of the component/function.  Without the original code, this is the best I can do.

// Example of how to declare the variables.  This would need to be placed in the correct scope
// within the original component/function.

const brevity = false
const it = false
const is = false
const correct = false
const and = false

// The rest of the original component code would follow here, using the declared variables.
// For example:
// if (brevity && it && is && correct && and) {
//   console.log("All variables are true");
// } else {
//   console.log("At least one variable is false");
// }

// Note: This is a placeholder.  The actual implementation depends on the original code.
