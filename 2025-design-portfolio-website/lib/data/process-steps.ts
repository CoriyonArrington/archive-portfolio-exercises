// No code provided, so I cannot apply the updates.
// Please provide the content of lib/data/process-steps.ts to proceed.
// Assuming the errors are due to missing imports or variable declarations,
// I would need the original code to determine the correct fix.
// For example, if the variables are meant to be boolean values, I could declare them as:
// const brevity = true;
// const it = true;
// const is = true;
// const correct = true;
// const and = true;
// However, this is just a placeholder and the actual solution depends on the original code.
