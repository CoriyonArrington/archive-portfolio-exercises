# 05: Reference

This section contains supplementary reference materials, glossaries, and tracking for known issues.

## Key Documents

-   **[Known Issues](./known-issues.md)**: Tracks ongoing technical debt, bugs, and workarounds. (You should already have your `known-issues.md` file here).
-   **[TODO: Add Glossary.md if needed for project-specific terms]**
-   **[TODO: Add links to external style guides or decision records]**

*This section can be expanded with other relevant reference documents as the project grows.*
