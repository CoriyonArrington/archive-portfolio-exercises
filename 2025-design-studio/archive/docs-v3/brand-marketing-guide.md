## 2. üß± CMS Model Diagram

# üß± CMS Model Diagram ‚Äî Coriyon‚Äôs Studio

This document outlines how content types relate within the CMS. These models power the admin dashboard and public-facing pages, managed through a modular `pages` table and related content entities.

---

## üåê Primary Content Model: `pages`

The `pages` table is the root of the CMS content system and links with specialized collections via type or slug-based dynamic routing.

### Fields
- `id` (UUID)
- `title` (TEXT)
- `slug` (TEXT)
- `type` (TEXT ‚Äî "main", "solution", "community", "resource", etc.)
- `content` (JSONB)
- `user_id`, `created_at`, `updated_at`

---

## üîÅ Related Collections by Type

### ‚û§ Main Pages
Examples: Home, About, Services, Contact  
- Standalone, stored in `pages`

### ‚û§ UX Solutions
Examples: Mobile App UX, UX Audits  
- Type = "solution"  
- Fully CMS-controlled under `/services/:slug`

### ‚û§ Community
Examples: Speaking, UXPA MN  
- Type = "community"  
- Used for credibility & social proof content

### ‚û§ Resources
Examples: FAQ, Process, Blog  
- Type = "resource"  
- Stored in `pages`, with dynamic subcontent stored in:
  - `faqs`
  - `process_phases`
  - `blog` (future)

---

## üì¶ CMS-Controlled Collections

These tables support repeatable, structured content:

| Table           | Description                              |
|------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `projects`       | Portfolio case studies                   |
| `services`       | UX services offered                      |
| `testimonials`   | Social proof (quote, name, role)         |
| `faqs`           | Answers to common client questions       |
| `process_phases` | Steps in the UX design process           |
| `blog` (future)  | Thought leadership & marketing           |

---

## üß† Admin Dashboard Mapping

Each collection maps directly to a dashboard route:

| Route                     | Table/Entity         |
|---------------------------|----------------------|
| `/dashboard/pages`        | `pages`              |
| `/dashboard/projects`     | `projects`           |
| `/dashboard/services`     | `services`           |
| `/dashboard/testimonials` | `testimonials`       |
| `/dashboard/faqs`         | `faqs`               |
| `/dashboard/process-phases` | `process_phases`   |
| `/dashboard/blog` (future)  | `blog`             |

---

## üí° Notes

- All content types support metadata: `user_id`, `created_at`, `updated_at`
- Most dynamic routes pull from `pages` or match via `slug`
- Extensible with playground tools and internal references if needed

## 3. üìà SEO Metadata


# üìà SEO Metadata ‚Äî Coriyon‚Äôs Studio

This guide defines how metadata is structured and optimized for SEO, social sharing, and discoverability across all major platforms. It supports both static and CMS-driven pages.

---

## üß† Metadata Fields (Global)

These are set in `config/site.ts` and injected on all pages:

| Field         | Description                                    |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `title`       | The default site name or page-specific title   |
| `description` | Description shown in search and social previews|
| `url`         | Canonical URL of the current page              |
| `og:image`    | Open Graph image for social sharing            |
| `keywords`    | Array of SEO keywords for the brand            |
| `twitter:card`| Sets format for Twitter link preview           |

---

## üßæ Page-Specific Meta (Via CMS or Page Component)

Each CMS-managed page supports optional overrides for metadata:

| Field              | Where it's used                        |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `meta_title`       | Overrides `<title>`                    |
| `meta_description` | Overrides `<meta name="description">` |
| `meta_image`       | Overrides OG image for page            |
| `slug`             | Used to generate canonical and OG URLs |

---

## üîç SEO Strategy Notes

- Slugs are short, keyword-rich, and match content hierarchy
- Blog posts and UX services use dynamic routing: `/blog/:slug`, `/services/:slug`
- Open Graph and Twitter meta tags are dynamically generated
- Sitemap and robots.txt are included via `next-sitemap`
- Pages are pre-rendered and optimized with ISR where applicable

Let me know if you'd like a JSON config version or dynamic meta field integration for the CMS.
