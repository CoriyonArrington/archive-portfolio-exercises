# üìà SEO Metadata ‚Äî Coriyon‚Äôs Studio

This guide defines how metadata is structured and optimized for SEO, social sharing, and discoverability across all major platforms. It supports both static and CMS-driven pages.

## üß† Metadata Fields (Global)

These are set in `config/site.ts` and injected on all pages:

| Field         | Description                                    |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `title`       | The default site name or page-specific title   |
| `description` | Description shown in search and social previews|
| `url`         | Canonical URL of the current page              |
| `og:image`    | Open Graph image for social sharing            |
| `keywords`    | Array of SEO keywords for the brand            |
| `twitter:card`| Sets format for Twitter link preview           |

## üßæ Page-Specific Meta (Via CMS or Page Component)

Each CMS-managed page supports optional overrides for metadata:

| Field              | Where it's used                        |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `meta_title`       | Overrides `<title>`                    |
| `meta_description` | Overrides `<meta name="description">` |
| `meta_image`       | Overrides OG image for page            |
| `slug`             | Used to generate canonical and OG URLs |

## üîç SEO Strategy Notes

- Slugs are short, keyword-rich, and match content hierarchy
- Blog posts and UX services use dynamic routing: `/blog/:slug`, `/services/:slug`
- Open Graph and Twitter meta tags are dynamically generated
- Sitemap and robots.txt are included via `next-sitemap`
- Pages are pre-rendered and optimized with ISR where applicable

Let me know if you'd like a JSON config version or dynamic meta field integration for the CMS.
